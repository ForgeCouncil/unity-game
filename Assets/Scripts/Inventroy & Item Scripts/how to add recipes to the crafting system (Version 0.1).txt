[How to add item "recipes" to the crafting system]

1. Pray to a dark god.

2. Open BrewingMenu.cs (Assets > Scripts > Inventory & Item Scripts > BrewingMenu.cs)

3. Scroll down to | public void Brew() |, line 95 as of right now.

4. Copy an existing recipe.

5. Change required ingredients in the 'if()' statement to the itemId strings of the desired ingredients.

6. Change the text of the second line to match the name of the instancer of the desired output
	brewResult = GameObject.Find("DontDestroyOnLoad/----Instancers----/CHANGE THIS PART");

7. Double check to make sure the recipe has 'SetBrewItem();' in the next line and 'return;' in the line after that.

8. Try it out!
